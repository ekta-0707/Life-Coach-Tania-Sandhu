      <h2>About Tania</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Tania Arora — a life coach, behavioral consultant, and soul on a mission.</p>

<p>I help people reconnect with who they truly are—beyond the noise, pressure, and expectations. Whether I’m working with children with autism, guiding teens through mindset shifts, or coaching adults ready to rewrite their stories, my mission is simple: to empower others to live with intention, faith, and freedom.</p>

<p>Originally from India and now based in Canada, my journey has been deeply shaped by cultural contrasts, healing work, and the decision to live life on my own terms. Along the way, I’ve learned the power of boundaries, self-awareness, and conscious creation—and I now teach others how to do the same.
</p>

I wear two main hats in my work:
<p> •  As a Behavioral Consultant, I support neurodiverse children and young adults in building essential life and communication skills with compassion, patience, and purpose.</p>
<p> •  As a Life Coach, I guide individuals of all ages to master their mindset, build confidence, and step into the life they’re truly meant to live—with faith, clarity, and alignment.</p>

<p>When I’m not coaching or consulting, you’ll find me recording episodes of my podcast Pilgrimage with Tia, writing my book Brown Boundaries, or dreaming up my next creative project. I believe in slow mornings, honest conversations, divine timing, and building a life that feels like home.</p>

<p>If you’re here, it’s probably because you’re ready for something more—more peace, more growth, more direction, or more purpose.</p>

<p>And I’m here to help you get there.</p>

Let’s begin your journey together.</p>
