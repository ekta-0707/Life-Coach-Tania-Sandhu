      <h2>About Tania</h2>
      <p>Helping you understand yourself—so you can lead yourself.</p>

<p>Hi, I’m Tania Arora — a Life Coach, Behavioral Consultant, and someone who’s always been curious about what’s really going on inside people’s minds.
</p>

<p>
That curiosity led me to study psychology and, in 2023, I completed my Master’s degree in Psychology. But more than the degree, it’s the lived experiences, deep listening, and honest conversations that shaped how I support others today.
</p>

<p>I work with people of all ages to help them reconnect with who they really are—whether that’s through life coaching or behavioral consulting. Some are working on mindset and emotional growth. Others are building communication and life skills. No matter what the goal is, my approach is always the same: honest, grounded, and heart-centered.
</p>
<p>I believe in slow mornings, divine timing, and building a life that feels like home. I believe healing doesn’t need to be rushed, and growth doesn’t have to be perfect. You don’t need to be "fixed"—you just need to feel safe enough to be seen, understood, and supported.
</p>

<p>If you're feeling a pull to explore yourself more deeply, to shift something from the inside out—I’d love to support you. You’re not alone in this. Let’s walk it together.</p>
